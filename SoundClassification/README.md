# Sound Classification Project

## Overview

This project involves building a sound classification model to identify different types of environmental sounds. Using the UrbanSound8K dataset, we aim to develop a model that accurately classifies various sound classes from audio recordings.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the UrbanSound8K dataset, which includes 8,732 labeled sound excerpts across 10 different categories. It is well-suited for training and evaluating audio classification models.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Scripts to preprocess and clean the audio data.
- **Feature Extraction:** Extraction of Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) for audio features.
- **Model Training:** Training of machine learning models on the processed audio data.
- **Model Evaluation:** Scripts to evaluate model performance and accuracy.
- **Predictions:** Tools for making predictions on new audio samples.
